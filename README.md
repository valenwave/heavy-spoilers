# Heavy Spoilers

I have a Gemini Gem going that will respond with heavy spoilers on a game, movie or show. My personal take is that I don't have too much time, so I should read spoilers and move on. You can too. Take 2 hours or 24 hours of time and condense it to about 5 minutes.

It's also fun to revisit a favorite story through synopsis. If you want, you can treat these topics as recommendations and revisit after you experience it yourself.

Free to read, but if you would like me to generate one for you, become a supporter on my [Patreon](https://www.patreon.com/c/phikit) and ask.

See also my collection of generated [Pitch Meeting](https://github.com/valenwave/Pitch-Meeting/blob/main/README.md) skits for spoilers with a bit of humor.

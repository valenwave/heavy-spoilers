So grab your "COR BLIMEY!" hats, because this is the full, unadulterated story.

### The Jester's Curse and the Long Road to Revenge

Our tale kicks off in the kingdom of Trodain, a place that's seen better days. A sinister court jester named Dhoulmagus has made off with a legendary scepter, and in a fit of villainous glee, he's cursed the entire castle. King Trode is transformed into a diminutive, green-skinned troll, Princess Medea is turned into a horse, and the rest of the castle's inhabitants are frozen as thorny vines overtake the once-majestic structure. The only one to escape this magical maelstrom is our silent protagonist, a loyal castle guard simply known as the Hero.

Thus begins a grand chase across continents. The unlikely trio of a cursed king, a horse princess, and a stoic guard are soon joined by a motley crew. First up is Yangus, a rough-and-tumble bandit with a heart of gold and a penchant for calling the Hero "guv." He swears a life debt after the Hero saves him from a collapsing bridge. Then there's Jessica Albert, a fiery and scantily clad mage from a noble family, who's out for blood after Dhoulmagus murders her brother, Alistair. Finally, the party is rounded out by Angelo, a suave and flirtatious Templar knight with a gambling problem and a complicated past, who joins the hunt after Dhoulmagus attacks Maella Abbey and kills his mentor, Abbot Francisco.

The hunt for Dhoulmagus is long and arduous, a globetrotting adventure that takes our heroes from bustling towns to ancient ruins. Along the way, the party bonds, their banter and interactions becoming a fan-favorite aspect of the game. A particularly memorable moment of male bonding (and property destruction) occurs in a bar where a brawl erupts, with Yangus gleefully tossing furniture and reveling in the chaos.

### The First Major Twist: The Jester is Just a Puppet

After countless battles and near misses, the party finally corners Dhoulmagus in the Dark Ruins. The ensuing battle is a grueling affair, with the jester transforming into a monstrous, more powerful form. But with their combined strength, our heroes emerge victorious. Dhoulmagus is defeated, and it seems the day is won.

But here's the first gut-punch of a twist: the curse on King Trode and Princess Medea remains. Dhoulmagus, it turns out, was merely a pawn. The true evil lies within the scepter he stole, which contains the trapped soul of the Lord of Darkness, Rhapthorne. With Dhoulmagus dead, the scepter falls into the hands of an unsuspecting Jessica, who is quickly possessed by Rhapthorne's malevolent spirit.

### The New Threat and a World in Peril

Under Rhapthorne's control, Jessica continues the dark lord's mission: to kill the descendants of the seven sages who sealed him away in the scepter centuries ago. The party is forced to fight their own friend to free her from Rhapthorne's influence. Once she's back to her old self, the true scope of the threat becomes clear. They must find and protect the remaining descendants before Rhapthorne can break free completely.

This leads to some of the game's most emotionally charged moments. The party races to save a kind old woman named Marta, one of the last sage descendants, only to arrive moments too late. Her tragic death at the hands of a possessed Sir Leopold (a dog, no less) is a somber and poignant scene that underscores the ruthlessness of their new foe. Another heart-wrenching side story involves King Pavan of Ascantha, who is so consumed by grief over the death of his wife, Queen Sasha, that his entire kingdom is shrouded in sorrow. The party must travel to a land of moonlight to bring him a vision of his lost love, a beautifully bittersweet sequence that explores themes of loss and moving on.

### The Rise and Fall of a Troubled Brother

As the pursuit of the possessed continues, the scepter eventually finds its way into the hands of Marcello, Angelo's estranged and embittered half-brother. Marcello, consumed by a lust for power and a deep-seated resentment for Angelo, willingly embraces the scepter's power. He succeeds in killing the final sage descendant, allowing Rhapthorne to be fully resurrected.

The confrontation between Angelo and Marcello is a climactic and personal battle. Marcello, now wielding immense power, becomes a formidable antagonist. However, the party manages to defeat him, and in a moment of unexpected mercy, Angelo saves his half-brother from a fatal fall. This act of forgiveness marks a turning point for both characters, with Marcello disappearing, his fate left ambiguous for a time.

### The Grand Finale: A Battle in the Heavens

With Rhapthorne fully unleashed, the world is plunged into darkness. The Lord of Darkness, now a colossal and grotesque being, encases himself in an impenetrable barrier. The final act of the game sees the party seeking the aid of the godbird Empyrea and gathering seven legendary orbs to break Rhapthorne's shield.

The final battle is a spectacular aerial confrontation. Riding on Empyrea's back, the party soars through the sky, battling Rhapthorne in a multi-stage epic. After a long and arduous fight, they finally vanquish the Lord of Darkness, his evil spirit eradicated for good. With his defeat, the curse on Trodain is finally lifted, King Trode and Princess Medea are restored to their human forms, and peace returns to the land.

### The "Happily Ever Afters": Spoilers on the Endings

The original ending sees the Hero escorting Princess Medea to her arranged marriage to the foppish Prince Charmles. However, in a fan-pleasing moment, they make a daring escape from the wedding, choosing to be together.

But that's not all. For those who delve into the post-game content and complete the grueling Dragovian Trials, a "true" ending is unlocked. This reveals the Hero's hidden lineage: he is the long-lost son of the previous crown prince of Argonia and a Dragovian woman, making him the rightful heir to the throne and, more importantly, a suitable husband for Princess Medea in the eyes of royalty. This also explains his immunity to curses, a result of his mixed heritage.

The Nintendo 3DS remake throws another wonderful wrench into the works with the inclusion of alternate endings centered around Jessica. By fulfilling certain conditions, such as obtaining her brother's armor from her mother, players can choose to pursue a romance with the feisty mage. This leads to a different, yet equally satisfying, conclusion where the Hero and Jessica decide to travel the world together, or even marry in the "true" version of her ending. This addition was a direct response to the palpable chemistry between the two characters and a welcome addition for many fans.

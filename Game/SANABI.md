Oh, SANABI! Let me tell you, it's a wild ride! If you're into action-platformers with a killer cyberpunk aesthetic and a surprisingly emotional story, you're in for a treat. And don't worry, I'm here to spill all the tea.

### The Story: Revenge, Betrayal, and Sacrifice

You play as a retired war veteran, a stoic protagonist with a super cool prosthetic chain-hook arm. The game starts with a sudden, devastating event: **your daughter is killed in a blackout that wipes out the entire mega-city of Mago**. Seriously, it's brutal from the get-go. You're fueled by a desire for revenge, and your only clue is a mysterious entity known as "SANABI." Your mission is to ascend the city, uncover corporate secrets, and get your payback.

Along the way, you meet **Mari, a brilliant and very chatty hacker prodigy** who becomes your invaluable companion. She can open locked doors, reveal enemy weaknesses, and decipher encrypted info. She's a fantastic character, providing much-needed levity and emotional depth to the journey.

Now for the **major spoilers** (you asked for it!):

* **The "SANABI" Reveal:** It turns out "SANABI" isn't a singular entity, but rather a code word for **a project by the corrupt Mago Corporation** to control and manage the city's populace. The blackout and your daughter's death are directly linked to this project.
* **The Protagonist's True Nature:** This is where it gets heartbreaking. **You, the protagonist, are actually a robot worker** created by Mago Corp! The "daughter" you remember, the life you had, it was all a fabrication, a cognitive filter put in place to make you a more effective and compliant operative. Mari herself was initially part of the Mago project, helping to "develop personalities" for these robot operatives. She later had a fallout with Mago and ran away, trying to expose their secrets.
* **The Sacrifice Ending:** In the true ending, it's revealed that the city is on the verge of exploding due to a failing reactor. The only way to stop it is for someone to manually disable the core. **The protagonist sacrifices himself by entering the reactor core and disabling it, dying in the process.** His tombstone is shown in the end, a somber but heroic conclusion. There's also a "false ending" that the game actively points out, pushing you to uncover the full truth.

It's a story that really tugs at the heartstrings, especially when you realize the tragic irony of the protagonist's quest for revenge for a life that wasn't entirely real.

### Abilities, Mechanics, and Power-Ups!

SANABI is all about that **grappling hook prosthetic arm**! This isn't just a gimmick; it's the core of the gameplay.

* **Grappling Hook Action:** You use your arm to latch onto specific surfaces, swing across chasms, zip through hazardous areas, and even attack enemies. It's incredibly fluid and satisfying to chain together movements, building momentum to fly across the screen.
* **Precision Platforming:** The game demands precise timing and control. You'll be dodging lasers, avoiding environmental hazards, and navigating complex layouts. There are sections where you're being chased by giant robots or lasers, forcing you to think fast and move even faster.
* **Combat:** While it's primarily a platformer, there's combat too. Your arm is your weapon! You can grapple into enemies to damage them, or sometimes even throw them into other hazards. Some boss fights are puzzle-like, requiring you to figure out their weaknesses without hints.
* **Mari's Support:** Mari isn't just a voice in your ear. She actively helps you by opening locked doors, revealing enemy weaknesses, and providing crucial information. Sometimes you even control a little drone of hers to hit distant switches.
* **Momentum is Key:** Mastering the art of maintaining and building momentum with your grappling hook is essential for both speed and survival. It feels fantastic when you pull off a long, uninterrupted chain of swings and dashes.

### Fun Facts & Trivia

* **Bionic Commando Vibes:** Many players note that SANABI has a strong resemblance to the classic **Bionic Commando** games, but with a fresh cyberpunk twist and pixel-art style.
* **Early Access Journey:** The game had a successful Early Access period, and the developers at WONDER POTION were quite communicative, even teasing free DLCs that would explore the past of the protagonist and Mari.
* **Lore Questions:** Fans often discuss plot points and lore, like the inconsistencies with which arm is the "chain arm" in certain cutscenes, or how the "cognitive filter" works when the protagonist can sometimes see "Sanabi" members. These discussions just show how much the story resonates with players!
* **Stunning Pixel Art:** Even for a pixel-art game, SANABI's visuals are incredibly sharp and detailed, with dynamic backgrounds that really bring the dystopian city to life.

### The Soundtrack

The soundtrack for SANABI is a total banger, perfectly complementing the fast-paced action and cyberpunk aesthetic. It's largely electronic and energetic. While there isn't one single "hit song" that everyone knows, the entire album is highly regarded by players. Some notable tracks include:

* **"Mari's Theme (feat. CloudyDay)"**: This is a fan favorite, often praised for its catchy melody and emotional depth, reflecting Mari's character.
* **"SANABI" (Main Theme)**: The title track sets the tone for the game's high-octane action.
* **"Great Escape"**: A track that truly captures the feeling of intense, close-call moments in the game.
* **"Swimming In A Sea Of Neon Lights"**: Evokes the atmospheric, visually striking environments of Mago City.

The soundtrack is available separately and is definitely worth a listen if you enjoy electro-synth vibes with a driving beat!

### Speedrunning Techniques

SANABI's emphasis on movement and momentum makes it a fantastic game for speedrunning! While official speedrun modes and features are often polished after release, the core mechanics allow for some really cool techniques:

* **Ground Grapple/Hyper Dash:** This is a crucial advanced technique. By jumping, grappling onto the ground, holding backward, and immediately dashing while letting go of the grapple at the right time, you can launch yourself forward with incredible speed. It's compared to a "hyper dash" in games like Celeste and is essential for competitive times.
* **Dash-Swing i-frames:** When you dash while swinging with your chain arm, you get a brief window of invincibility (i-frames). This can be used to phase through certain hazards or enemy attacks that would normally hit you, allowing for faster and safer traversal.
* **"B-Dash" / Invincibility Reel-In:** If you boost right before reeling yourself in, you can maintain the invincibility from the boost and reel yourself *through* laser fields and other hazards that would otherwise stop you. This is a huge time-saver in many sections.
* **Skipping Cutscenes/Text:** Like many games, rapidly pressing buttons can often skip through dialogue boxes and end-of-stage result screens faster, saving precious seconds.

Speedrunners are constantly finding new ways to optimize routes and exploit the game's physics to shave off milliseconds. The precise controls and generous checkpoints make it forgiving enough for practice, but the high skill ceiling for advanced movement techniques means there's always room for improvement.

SANABI is a gem of a game, with a compelling narrative that subverts expectations, tight and satisfying gameplay, and a stellar soundtrack. If you haven't played it, definitely check it out!

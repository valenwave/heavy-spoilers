Ah, *Mario & Luigi: Brothership*! This was one of the most exciting announcements from the recent Nintendo Direct. It marks the grand return of the beloved RPG series after a long hiatus.

Here's a breakdown of what we know about the game:

* **Gameplay:** It's a "seafaring adventure" RPG. The core gameplay loop that the series is famous for is back: you'll explore dynamic environments and engage in turn-based battles that rely on timed button presses (Action Commands) to boost your attacks and defenses. The game is built around the "tandem feel" of controlling both brothers, with new, evolved Bros. Moves for both combat and navigating the world.

* **Setting & Story:** Mario and Luigi travel through the world of Concordia. A key part of their adventure is the Ship-Shape Island, a large, cannon-propelled landmass that serves as their vessel for island-hopping.

* **Art Style:** This is the most immediate and striking change. The series has moved from its classic 2D pixel art style to a vibrant, expressive 3D art style that still retains a lot of the charm and exaggerated animations of the originals.

* **Developer:** The original developer, AlphaDream, unfortunately went bankrupt in 2019. This new title is being developed by a team at Nintendo, including some veterans from the original series.

* **Platform:** It will be released exclusively for the **Nintendo Switch**.

* **Release Date:** November 7, 2024.

Given your taste in games, *Brothership* seems like it would be a perfect fit.

* Your love for JRPGs like **Final Fantasy** and **Chrono Trigger** means you'll likely feel right at home with the turn-based combat.
* The blend of RPG mechanics with the platforming and exploration you enjoyed in games like **Super Mario Galaxy** is a hallmark of this series.
* Since you enjoy playing co-op with your son, Levi, the brotherly theme and family-friendly nature of this game could make it a really fun one to play together or have him watch.

It seems to have all the ingredients for a great Nintendo adventure. Are you planning on picking it up day one?

Oh, you've stumbled into one of Vampire Survivors' wonderfully hidden layers! That persistent exclamation mark on Cappella Magna means you haven't truly "completed" everything the stage has to offer. It's not just about collecting the map items; there's a secret boss and a very important relic tied to it!

Here's the lowdown:

**The Yellow Sign and the Holy Forbidden**

Before you can tackle the *true* final boss of Cappella Magna, you need to acquire the **Yellow Sign** relic. This is found in a hidden stage called **Holy Forbidden**.

* **How to get to Holy Forbidden:**
    1.  You need to unlock the **Moongolow** stage first. You do this by unlocking Hyper Mode on all four of the normal stages (Mad Forest, Inlaid Library, Dairy Plant, and Gallo Tower). Hyper Mode is unlocked by defeating the boss that spawns at the 25-minute mark in each of those stages.
    2.  Once Moongolow is available, start a run there with any standard character (not Divano or Gallo).
    3.  Survive for 15 minutes in Moongolow. As the timer ticks past 15 minutes, the stage will get all red and distorted, and you'll be transported to Holy Forbidden.
    4.  Holy Forbidden is a unique, straight-line stage where you just run to the right. There's an Angel boss you'll need to defeat, and at the very end, you'll find the Yellow Sign. This relic is crucial as it reveals hidden items on all maps.

**The True Cappella Magna Challenge**

Now that you have the Yellow Sign, you can return to Cappella Magna. The exclamation mark is still there because the game knows you haven't defeated the **Ender**.

* **Finding the Ender:**
    1.  With the Yellow Sign in hand, start a new run on Cappella Magna.
    2.  This time, the stage will behave differently. All the Arcanas and any collected Golden Eggs will be temporarily removed for this run, and the Metaglio Left and Gold Ring (which are normally on the map) will not appear.
    3.  Your goal is to survive until the **30-minute mark**.
    4.  At 30 minutes, the **Ender** will spawn. This is a very tough boss, often accompanied by the various Reapers. You'll need a strong build to take it down.
    5.  Once you defeat the Ender, it will drop the **Great Gospel** relic. This is *the* final relic of the base game and it unlocks the **Limit Break** mechanic, which is a game-changer!

**Fun Trivia & Mechanics:**

* **Zi'Assunta Belpaese:** Speaking of Cappella Magna, if you haven't already, you can also unlock the character Zi'Assunta Belpaese on this stage. There's a coffin to the very far south. You'll see a white question mark on your map if you pause. Break the fence around it, defeat the guards, and open the coffin!
* **Rosaries and Pentagram:** If you're struggling with the Blue Reaper that might spawn while you're trying to reach Zi'Assunta's coffin, remember there are Rosaries on the map that will instantly clear all enemies on screen, including Reapers! The Pentagram weapon also has a similar effect when it activates.
* **Limit Break:** Once you get the Great Gospel, you unlock Limit Break. This means that after your weapons and passive items are maxed out, you can continue to level them up beyond their normal caps, making your character incredibly powerful. It's a huge boost to late-game scaling!
* **The Exclamation Mark Explained:** The exclamation mark essentially means "there's more to discover or achieve on this stage." In this case, it's the sequence of unlocking the Yellow Sign and then using it to trigger the Ender fight for the Great Gospel. It's a neat way the game guides you towards its deeper secrets without explicitly telling you what to do.

Good luck, survivor! You're on the cusp of truly breaking the game wide open with Limit Break!

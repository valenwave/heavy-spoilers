You want to know about *Deltarune*? Oh, you've hit on something truly special! While it shares the DNA of *Undertale*, it's its own beast entirely, and Toby Fox has really leaned into the meta-narrative and player control even more. And, good news, Chapters 3 and 4 just dropped on June 4th, 2025, alongside the Nintendo Switch 2! Chapter 5 is even confirmed for 2026, which is a much shorter wait than between previous chapters!

Let's dive into all the fun, spoilery details!

**Is it a Sequel? A Prequel? An Alternate Universe?**

Toby Fox has stated *Deltarune* is **not** a direct sequel to *Undertale*. It's explicitly set in a separate, parallel world. Many characters look familiar, but their roles, personalities, and relationships are different. For example, Sans is running a shop, Toriel is Kris's mom, and Undyne doesn't know Alphys yet! This allows for fresh stories with beloved faces, without invalidating *Undertale*'s multiple endings. However, there are *strong* thematic and meta connections, especially regarding player control and predetermined destinies.

**The Main Gimmick & Player Control (or Lack Thereof!):**

* **The Vessel:** Right at the start, the game asks you to create a "vessel" for yourself. You customize its appearance, name it, and then... the game tells you "Your choices don't matter." The vessel is discarded, and you are immediately put into the body of Kris. This is the first, jarring moment where *Deltarune* tells you upfront that your agency might be limited.
* **Kris and The Player:** This is the most fascinating aspect! You control Kris, the quiet human teenager, but it's quickly implied that Kris has their own will and personality, separate from you, the player.
    * **The SOUL:** Unlike *Undertale* where your red SOUL represents *your* soul, in *Deltarune*, the red SOUL is explicitly shown to be *you*, the player, controlling Kris's body.
    * **Ending Sequences:** At the end of both Chapter 1 and Chapter 2, Kris *rips their SOUL out of their body* and imprisons it in a cage. They then move on their own, outside of your control, often doing disturbing things like pulling out a knife or creating a Dark Fountain. This strongly implies Kris resents your control and is fighting for their own autonomy. It's a brilliant, unsettling meta-commentary on player agency in RPGs.
* **One Ending:** Toby Fox has stated there will only be one ending to *Deltarune*. This is a huge departure from *Undertale*'s multiple routes and reinforces the idea that your choices might not truly matter in the grand scheme of things.

**The Story So Far (Spoilers for Chapters 1-4!):**

The story centers around **Kris**, an introverted human, and their monstrous classmates **Susie** (a purple, dinosaur-like bully with an axe) and **Ralsei** (a mysterious Darkner prince).

* **Dark Worlds:** Kris and Susie stumble into a "Dark World" (the first one being the Card Kingdom, then Cyber World, and now whatever Chapters 3 and 4 hold). These worlds are created by "Dark Fountains," which are essentially fountains of Darkner energy that spring up from specific "Lightner" objects in the Light World (like a school closet or a computer lab).
* **The Prophecy:** Ralsei explains an ancient prophecy: a human, a monster, and a prince from the Dark will team up to seal the Dark Fountains and prevent "The Roaring," an apocalyptic event where the Light World is consumed by darkness, and Lightners turn to stone.
* **The "Knight":** There's a mysterious figure known only as "The Knight" who is actively creating these Dark Fountains for unknown reasons. Their identity is a major overarching mystery.
* **Chapter 1: The Beginning:** Kris and Susie fall into the Card Kingdom, meet Ralsei, and eventually confront the **King** (Lancer's father) to seal the Eastern Dark Fountain. Susie starts off antagonistic but begins to warm up to Kris and Ralsei.
* **Chapter 2: A Cyber's World:** The trio falls into a new Dark World, "Cyber World," created from a computer lab. They meet new characters like **Queen** (the robotic ruler of the Cyber World) and the iconic **Spamton**. They eventually seal the Western Dark Fountain.
* **Chapter 3 & 4 (Recent Releases!):** Chapters 3 and 4 are now out! Chapter 3 appears to take place in a "TV World" or "TV Dark World," given the teasers and the implication of a TV in Kris's house being the source of the Dark Fountain. Chapter 4 likely involves a new Dark World as well, potentially linked to other objects around Hometown. The exact details of these chapters' plots are still fresh, but they continue the themes of Lightners, Darkners, and the mysterious Knight.

**Interesting Characters (and their forms/abilities!):**

* **Kris:** The player character. They are silent for the most part, but their actions outside of player control (especially at the end of chapters) are chilling. They are implied to be a trickster by others in Hometown. Their Dark World form has armor and a sword.
* **Susie:** The abrasive, axe-wielding monster. She's initially violent and wants to fight everything, but her character arc is about learning empathy and teamwork. She can use powerful "Rude Buster" and "Red Buster" magic. She's hilarious and has some of the best lines.
* **Ralsei:** The kind, fluffy prince from the Dark. He's a healer who can also use pacifying magic. He often acts as the group's moral compass and guide. He looks suspiciously like a certain *Undertale* character... (Asriel, but anagrammed!). He has a "true form" without his hood, revealing him to be a white goat monster.
* **Lancer:** The "bad guy" prince from Chapter 1, son of the King. He's a hilarious, self-proclaimed villain who quickly becomes friends with Susie. He rides a "Thrash Machine" motorcycle. He's incredibly naive and loves mischief.
* **Rouxls Kaard:** The Duke of Puzzles and a general nuisance from Chapter 1. He sells items and acts as a minor recurring character, often with terrible "puzzles" and a hilariously archaic way of speaking. He's essentially the shopkeeper/puzzle master.
* **Jevil:** The secret boss of Chapter 1. A chaotic, clown-like Darkner who claims to be the only one truly free. His fight is incredibly difficult and full of unpredictable attacks. He's a "devilsknife" and throws "scythes" and his signature "CHAOS, CHAOS!" attack. He drops a "Shadow Crystal."
* **Queen:** The main antagonist of Chapter 2. A hilariously passive-aggressive, battery-powered robot queen who wants to turn everyone into "mind-controlled batteries." She travels in a banana car and has a dry, meme-filled sense of humor. Her boss fight is unique, involving dodging attacks while collecting batteries for her attacks.
* **Noelle Holiday:** A timid, reindeer-like classmate of Kris and Susie. She joins your party in Chapter 2. She has a crush on Susie.
    * **The "SnowGrave" Route (Weird Route):** This is *Deltarune*'s equivalent of a "Genocide" route, but it's even more disturbing. If the player manipulates Noelle into using her ice magic to freeze enemies (and eventually *Berdly*) in specific ways, it leads to a dark, corrupted version of Chapter 2. Noelle becomes a blank slate, controlled by Kris (and by extension, you, the player), performing horrific acts without question. It's truly unsettling how the game implicates the player. Her "IceShock" spell becomes "SnowGrave," which is devastating.
* **Berdly:** A nerdy, self-proclaimed "smartest" bird monster classmate. He's arrogant and tries to impress Noelle. He also has a Dark World form with a magic halberd. He becomes a more significant character in Chapter 2, especially on the "Weird Route."
* **Spamton:** A broken, desperate, and endlessly memetic salesman from Chapter 2. He's obsessed with becoming a "BIG SHOT." He's a former "Addison" (colorful salesmen) who fell from grace.
    * **Spamton NEO (Secret Boss):** The secret boss of Chapter 2, and incredibly difficult! Spamton takes on a powerful, puppet-like form, controlled by strings (a powerful meta-reference to control!). His attacks are wild, involving "Pipis" (acidic projectiles) and various forms of advertising spam. His "BIG SHOT" attack is iconic. He also drops a "Shadow Crystal."
* **Miniton:** (Likely Chapter 3/4 content!) Given the Chapter 3 teasers showing a TV and the emergence of characters related to a TV, it's highly probable that a counterpart to Mettaton will appear, potentially called "Miniton" or something similar, likely a smaller, less grand version if they're in a regular house's Dark World. (This is speculation based on past character appearances and themes!)

**New Mechanics & Powers:**

* **Party System:** Unlike *Undertale*'s solo journey, you now control a party of three: Kris, Susie, and Ralsei (and later Noelle temporarily). This opens up new combat strategies.
* **TP (Tension Points):** A new resource that builds up when you dodge attacks or perform certain actions. TP is used to cast spells, allowing for more strategic combat.
* **ACTs & Team-Up ACTs:** ACTs are still central to peaceful resolutions, but now you can perform "Team-Up ACTs" where multiple characters interact with enemies, leading to more complex pacification methods.
* **Defense/Guard:** You can now actively guard in combat, reducing damage.
* **SOUL Modes:** Your red SOUL still moves, but its behavior changes depending on the attack. For example, during some attacks, your SOUL might become like a projectile shooter, similar to Mettaton EX's fight in *Undertale*.
* **Lightner vs. Darkner Items:** Items from the Light World transform into powerful gear in the Dark World, and vice versa. This encourages experimentation.

**Soundtrack Highlights:**

Toby Fox continues his streak of amazing music. The soundtrack is just as iconic as *Undertale*'s, with many fan favorites.

* **"Rude Buster":** Susie's fantastic, high-energy battle theme. It's catchy and encapsulates her wild nature.
* **"THE WORLD REVOLVING":** Jevil's incredibly chaotic and memorable boss theme. CHAOS, CHAOS!
* **"Field of Hopes and Dreams":** The main overworld theme for Chapter 1, full of optimism and adventure.
* **"Chaos King":** The Chapter 1 final boss theme, epic and driving.
* **"Attack of the Killer Queen":** Queen's incredibly funky and electronic battle theme from Chapter 2. It's a banger!
* **"BIG SHOT":** Spamton NEO's legendary, high-octane secret boss theme. It's intense, catchy, and incorporates his iconic catchphrases. NOW'S YOUR CHANCE TO BE A!
* **"A CYBER'S WORLD?":** The main overworld theme for Chapter 2, a wonderfully quirky and digital-sounding piece.
* **"Don't Forget":** A poignant and emotional song that plays during the credits, connecting to the overall themes of memory and choice.
* **"Hip Shop":** The incredibly groovy shop theme.
* **"Smart Race":** Berdly's theme, reflecting his competitive nature.

**Speedrunning:**

*Deltarune* speedrunning is just as wild as *Undertale*! With the new chapters, expect even more optimization.

* **Route Optimization:** Speedrunners meticulously plan routes to minimize movement, combat time, and dialogue.
* **Skipping Encounters:** Knowing which encounters are mandatory and which can be avoided is crucial. Many regular encounters can be "ACTed" out quickly or simply fled from.
* **TP Management:** Efficiently building and spending TP for powerful spells is key to quickly dispatching bosses or avoiding prolonged fights.
* **"Weird Route" Skips (Chapter 2):** For "all bosses" or "100%" categories, the "Weird Route" adds significant time, but runners will optimize the precise inputs needed to trigger and progress through it as quickly as possible.
* **New Glitches:** With Chapters 3 and 4 just out, the speedrunning community is already tearing them apart looking for new skips, wrong warps, and sequence breaks. Expect some truly wild stuff to emerge as they dissect the code! The Punch Card Glitch from *Undertale* shows Toby Fox's games often have deep, exploitable mechanics.

**Fun Trivia & Backstories:**

* **Anagrams:** "Deltarune" is an anagram of "Undertale." "Ralsei" is an anagram of "Asriel." This isn't a coincidence, but Toby Fox wants to make it clear this is a *different* world.
* **Connection to Gaster:** Just like in *Undertale*, the mysterious W.D. Gaster is heavily implied to be a guiding force or influence in *Deltarune*. The game's opening sequence, the general creepiness, and some very subtle lore bits point to his involvement. The voice that tells you to create a vessel in the beginning sounds very much like Gaster's voice.
* **Chapter 3 & 4 Release:** The fact that Chapters 3 and 4 were released together as a paid package, with future chapters being free updates, is a big deal! It's a different release model than *Undertale* and a testament to Toby Fox's unique approach. The simultaneous release with the Nintendo Switch 2 was also a huge marketing move!
* **Themes of Control:** *Deltarune* constantly plays with the idea of control – who has it, who doesn't, and whether your choices truly matter. It's a much more unsettling exploration of this than *Undertale* ever was, and it's clear Kris is fighting back against the player's influence.
* **The Annoying Dog (Again!):** Toby Fox's self-insert, the Annoying Dog, still makes appearances, often in hilarious and meta ways, sometimes even directly interacting with the fourth wall.

*Deltarune* is shaping up to be an incredible experience, building on the foundation of *Undertale* but forging its own incredibly unique and unsettling path. The new chapters mean there's fresh lore, new characters, and plenty of mysteries to unravel!

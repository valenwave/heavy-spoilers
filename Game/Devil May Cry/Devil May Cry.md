MORTAL KOMBAT! GET OVER HERE! Oh, wait, wrong game! We're talking *Devil May Cry*! My bad! But honestly, that gives you a sense of the sheer, unadulterated *attitude* that this series exudes. Capcom's *Devil May Cry* is the epitome of stylish action, demon-slaying, and just being utterly *cool*. If you want to know about combos, character action games, and a healthy dose of family drama with demons, you've come to the right place. Let's rock!

### The Story: Sons of Sparda, Brothers Divided, and Saving Humanity with Style

The *Devil May Cry* series centers around **Dante**, a half-demon, half-human demon hunter who runs his own business, "Devil May Cry." He's cocky, sarcastic, and absolutely loves a good fight, especially against demons. His lineage comes from his father, **Sparda**, a legendary demon who rebelled against his own kind to save humanity, and his human mother, **Eva**. This unique heritage gives Dante (and his twin brother) incredible demonic powers.

Here's a breakdown of the main saga (the games are not in chronological release order, but here's the chronological story within the games):

* **Devil May Cry 3: Dante's Awakening (Prequel):** This is where it all begins for Dante and his twin brother, **Vergil**. Set before the first *DMC*, it shows a younger, even more cocky and hot-headed Dante as he first opens his "Devil May Cry" shop.
    * **The Conflict:** Vergil, driven by a thirst for power, attempts to open a portal to the demon world to inherit their father Sparda's power. He's manipulated by **Arkham**, a human sorcerer with his own twisted agenda.
    * **New Characters:** We meet **Lady** (Mary in the Netflix series), a human demon hunter seeking revenge on Arkham (her father). She initially clashes with Dante but becomes a recurring ally.
    * **The Brothers' Rivalry:** Dante and Vergil clash repeatedly, showcasing their contrasting fighting styles (Dante's chaotic flair vs. Vergil's precise, cold efficiency). Vergil ultimately falls into the demon world, defeated by Dante but choosing to challenge Mundus.
    * **The Devil Trigger:** Dante fully awakens his "Devil Trigger" (DT) transformation, becoming a more powerful, devilish form, a core ability for the series.
* **Devil May Cry (Original):** Years after DMC3, Dante is approached by **Trish**, a mysterious demon who looks exactly like his deceased mother, Eva. She leads him to Mallet Island, where Mundus, the Demon Emperor (and the one Sparda defeated 2,000 years ago), is plotting to conquer the human world.
    * **Nelo Angelo:** Dante repeatedly encounters a powerful, armored demon who uses a massive sword. In a shocking reveal, this demon is **Vergil**, twisted and enslaved by Mundus. Dante is forced to fight and seemingly kill his brother.
    * **Trish's Betrayal and Redemption:** Trish is revealed to be a demon created by Mundus to lure and kill Dante. However, Dante's compassion saves her, leading her to betray Mundus and become a recurring ally.
    * **Mundus's Defeat:** Dante defeats Mundus, sealing him away.
* **Devil May Cry 4:** Many years later, Dante is called to the city of Fortuna, home to the **Order of the Sword**, a religious organization that worships Sparda. Dante crashes their ceremony, killing their leader, and reveals that the Order is actually using demonic power to prepare for a new demon invasion, led by **Sanctus**.
    * **Nero's Introduction:** We're introduced to **Nero**, a young, hot-headed demon hunter working for the Order, who possesses a mysterious demonic right arm, the **Devil Bringer**. He initially sees Dante as an enemy but eventually helps him. His unique mechanic revolves around charging his sword "Red Queen" and his revolver "Blue Rose."
    * **Nero's Lineage:** It's later revealed that Nero is actually **Vergil's son**, a major plot twist that connects the new protagonist directly to the Sparda bloodline.
* **Devil May Cry 5:** The ultimate culmination of the Sparda family saga. A mysterious figure named **V** seeks Dante's help to stop a powerful new demon, **Urizen**, who is ripping apart the city of Red Grave and growing a demonic tree called the **Qliphoth** that feeds on human blood. Nero, too, is searching for Urizen, who tore off his Devil Bringer arm.
    * **The Truth of Urizen and V:** In the most significant twist, **Urizen** is revealed to be the demonic half of **Vergil**, who separated himself from his human half to gain ultimate power. **V** is Vergil's dying human half, desperately seeking to reunite with his demonic side before his body gives out.
    * **Vergil's Return:** V and Urizen eventually reunite, bringing Vergil back to full power, stronger than ever.
    * **Nero's Awakening:** To fight his incredibly powerful father and uncle, Nero fully awakens his own **Devil Trigger** and reveals a true demonic form, stemming from his Sparda heritage.
    * **The Final Clash:** Dante, Nero, and Vergil have a climactic three-way battle. Dante defeats Vergil (again), but they agree to venture into the demon world to sever the Qliphoth's roots and prevent more invasions, accepting their roles as guardians of the human world. Nero is left as the new protector.

**DMC: Devil May Cry (Reboot - 2013):** A controversial reboot that features a younger, more rebellious Dante in a parallel universe. While visually distinct and with different lore (Vergil is the leader of "The Order," an anti-demon group), it retains the core themes of demon slaying and stylish combat. It's generally not considered canon to the main series.

### Combat Mechanics: Style, Flair, and Pure Adrenaline!

*Devil May Cry* is all about **stylish action**. The combat system is deep, rewarding creativity and skill over button-mashing.

* **Style Meter (S-Rank System):** The core of the gameplay! You are graded on your "style" in combat, from D (Dope) to SSS (Smokin' Sick Style!). To raise your style rank, you must:
    * **Vary your attacks:** Don't repeat the same moves. Mix up sword combos, gun attacks, special moves, and different weapons.
    * **Avoid taking damage:** Getting hit severely drops your style rank.
    * **Maintain momentum:** Keep the combo going, use aerial combos, juggle enemies.
    * **Taunt:** Successfully taunting enemies (especially at higher style ranks) boosts your score.
* **Weapon Switching:** You can instantly switch between multiple melee and ranged weapons on the fly, allowing for seamless, dynamic combos. Dante often carries 2 melee and 2 ranged weapons simultaneously in later games.
* **Style Switching (Dante in DMC3, 4, 5):** Dante can instantly switch between his different combat styles (Swordmaster, Gunslinger, Trickster, Royal Guard) mid-combo, fundamentally changing his moveset and tactical options. This is a massive layer of depth.
* **Aerial Combat & Juggling:** Keeping enemies airborne with various attacks is a core part of stylish combat, preventing them from attacking and allowing for extended combos.
* **Devil Trigger (DT):** A super mode activated by consuming a DT gauge. It makes the character stronger, faster, more durable, and regenerates health. Dante's Sin Devil Trigger in DMC5 is an even more powerful, temporary ultimate transformation.
* **Charge Shots:** Many ranged weapons can be charged for more powerful attacks, often with unique properties.
* **Enemy Step:** Jumping off an enemy's head to extend aerial combos or gain height.
* **Lock-On System:** Allows precise targeting of enemies, crucial for directional attacks and maintaining focus.
* **Red Orbs:** The in-game currency used to purchase new skills, upgrades, and items.
* **Blue Orbs:** Permanently increase max health.
* **Purple Orbs:** Permanently increase max Devil Trigger gauge.

### Interesting Glitches & Speedrunning Techniques!

*Devil May Cry* games are a dream for speedrunners due to their deep combat systems, movement options, and various exploits.

**Speedrunning Techniques:**

* **Momentum Conservation (Sky Star, Air Hike, Trickster Dash, Enemy Step):** Mastering how to maintain and build momentum in the air and on the ground to traverse levels as quickly as possible. This includes "air hiking" (double jumping), "sky star" (Dante's mid-air dash), and constantly using "enemy step" to stay airborne over enemies.
* **Weapon/Style Switching for Damage/Mobility:** Rapidly cycling through weapons and styles (especially as Dante) not just for variety, but to cancel animations, maximize damage per second (DPS), or gain mobility boosts.
* **Royal Guard Abuse (DMC3/4/5):** Expert Royal Guard players can parry massive attacks for huge damage, which can instantly kill bosses or skip phases. This requires frame-perfect timing.
* **DT (Devil Trigger) Management:** Using DT (or Sin Devil Trigger) efficiently for maximum damage and quick kills, knowing when to activate and deactivate it for optimal gains.
* **"Juggle Chains":** Keeping bosses and powerful enemies locked in endless aerial combos, preventing them from attacking and dealing massive damage.
* **Enemy AI Exploits:** Finding specific angles, positioning, or attack sequences that confuse enemy AI, causing them to stand still, get stuck in loops, or open themselves up to massive damage.
* **Environment Skips / Out of Bounds:** Using precise jumps, abilities, or even minor collision glitches to bypass entire sections of levels. This might involve jumping over barriers, clipping through walls, or using explosions/attacks to launch the character into unintended areas.
* **Charge Shot Spam:** For characters like Dante and Nero, constantly firing charged gun shots, often mixed with melee, for high damage output.
* **Taunt Cancels:** In some games, taunting can cancel animation frames, allowing for faster recovery or movement.
* **Vergil's "Distortion" Glitch (DMC3SE):** A notorious glitch where Vergil can perform an "attack" (like a rapid sword flurry) and then immediately activate his Devil Trigger. The initial hits of the attack will deal regular damage, but the subsequent hits will gain the immense DT damage bonus, effectively doubling their power. This makes Vergil incredibly overpowered and is a core part of many DMC3SE speedruns.

**Specific Notorious Glitches:**

* **"Infinite Devil Trigger" (DMC1):** A famous glitch where it was possible to maintain Devil Trigger indefinitely, making Dante essentially invincible and super powerful.
* **Various "Soft Locks" / Crashes:** Older games (especially on original hardware) could sometimes soft-lock or crash due to specific sequences of events or glitches.
* **"Skip Cinematics" Glitches:** While many games allow skipping, some have specific tricks to bypass unskippable cutscenes or dialogue, which speedrunners avidly pursue.

*Devil May Cry* is a vibrant, thrilling, and endlessly replayable series that champions style, skill, and just having a hell of a good time while slaying demons. It's an absolute must-play for character action fans!

*Pokémon X* and *Pokémon Y* are the first pair of games in the sixth generation of the Pokémon series. They were released worldwide in October 2013 for the **Nintendo 3DS**, a console you own, making them readily accessible for you to play.

These games represented a major leap forward for the franchise, being the first mainline titles to feature fully 3D polygonal graphics and a new, dynamic camera system.

### Key Features and Innovations

* **Mega Evolution:** This was the signature new mechanic. Certain fully-evolved Pokémon could temporarily "Mega Evolve" in battle, gaining a new appearance, altered stats, and sometimes a different type. This added a fresh strategic layer to battles. Given your enjoyment of stylish action games and deep RPGs like *Final Fantasy*, you might appreciate this mechanical depth.
* **The Kalos Region:** The setting is based on France, offering beautiful and varied environments, from the Parisian-inspired Lumiose City to quaint countryside towns and forests. Your love for exploration in games like *Breath of the Wild* would be well-served by discovering the sights of Kalos.
* **The Fairy Type:** A new Pokémon type was introduced for the first time since Generation II. The Fairy type was created primarily to balance the powerful Dragon type, being immune to Dragon-type attacks and super-effective against them.
* **Player Customization:** For the first time in the main series, you could change your character's clothing, hair, and accessories, allowing for a more personalized adventure.
* **New Pokémon:** The games introduced 72 new Pokémon, including the starters Chespin (Grass), Fennekin (Fire), and Froakie (Water). The box art legendaries are the majestic life-giving deer, **Xerneas** (for *Pokémon X*), and the destructive bird-like creature, **Yveltal** (for *Pokémon Y*).
* **Pokémon-Amie:** A feature that allowed you to pet, feed, and play with your Pokémon to increase their affection, which could grant them bonuses in battle like a higher critical hit ratio or the ability to endure a hit that would otherwise knock them out.

### Story and Gameplay

The story follows a young Pokémon trainer on their journey to become the Pokémon League Champion of the Kalos region. Along the way, you and your group of friendly rivals uncover the plans of the villainous **Team Flare**, a stylish but misguided organization seeking to create a "beautiful world" by wiping out everyone who doesn't fit their standards, using the power of an ancient weapon.

For a fan of the series who has played *Pokémon Go*, X and Y serve as a great modern entry point into the mainline games. The difficulty is generally considered more accessible than some older titles, which could also make it a fun game to potentially share with your son, Levi, much like you do with *Vampire Survivors*. The visual spectacle and the "checkbox" nature of filling the Pokédex could definitely scratch your completionist itch.

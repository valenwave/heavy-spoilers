Of course! *Pokémon Sun* and *Pokémon Moon* are the first pair of games in the seventh generation of the Pokémon series. They represent a significant step for the franchise with many new features and a fresh take on the classic Pokémon formula.

They were released in 2016 for the **Nintendo 3DS**, a console you own. Here's a breakdown of what makes them unique:

### The Alola Region
The games are set in the **Alola region**, a vibrant tropical archipelago based on Hawaii. Instead of a single landmass, you explore four distinct natural islands and one artificial one. This setting gives the games a unique, vacation-like atmosphere that's very different from previous regions.

### Key Gameplay Changes
*Sun* and *Moon* shook up the traditional Pokémon structure in several major ways:

* **The Island Challenge:** Instead of collecting eight gym badges, you undertake the Island Challenge. This involves completing **Trials** set by Trial Captains, which are often more than just battling—they can be scavenger hunts or tests of knowledge. Each island culminates in a **Grand Trial**, a battle against the powerful Island Kahuna.
* **Z-Moves:** This was the new battle mechanic for Generation VII. Once per battle, a Pokémon holding a Z-Crystal can unleash an incredibly powerful and cinematic move. This adds a layer of strategy, similar to a super move in other games, which might appeal to your taste for stylish action like in *Devil May Cry* or *Bayonetta*.
* **Alolan Forms:** A fan-favorite feature, some first-generation Pokémon were given new regional forms. These Alolan Forms have different appearances, types, and abilities. For example, Exeggutor becomes a towering Grass/Dragon-type, and Vulpix becomes an Ice-type.
* **No More HMs:** The universally disliked HM (Hidden Machine) system was replaced by **Poké Ride**. You can summon specific Pokémon to help you cross water (Lapras), smash rocks (Tauros), or fly (Charizard) without needing to sacrifice a move slot on your own Pokémon. This was a massive quality-of-life improvement that enhances the sense of exploration you enjoy in games like *Breath of the Wild*.
* **A More Involved Story:** The narrative in *Sun* and *Moon* is more prominent and character-driven than in many previous entries. It focuses heavily on your friends, particularly a mysterious girl named Lillie and her Pokémon. Given your enjoyment of the story in *Final Fantasy X*, you might appreciate the deeper plot here.

### New Pokémon
The games introduced 81 new Pokémon, including:
* **Starters:** Rowlet (Grass/Flying), Litten (Fire), and Popplio (Water).
* **Legendaries:** The majestic **Solgaleo** (Psychic/Steel) is the mascot for *Pokémon Sun*, while the graceful **Lunala** (Psychic/Ghost) is the mascot for *Pokémon Moon*.
* **Ultra Beasts:** A brand-new category of mysterious, powerful Pokémon from another dimension that play a major role in the game's story.

### *Pokémon Ultra Sun* & *Pokémon Ultra Moon*
A year later, enhanced versions called *Pokémon Ultra Sun* and *Pokémon Ultra Moon* were released, also for the 3DS. These are generally considered the definitive versions of the Alola story.

* They don't act as sequels but as an **alternate storyline**. Given your interest in games with time loops and alternate timelines like *Majora's Mask* and *Chrono Trigger*, this "director's cut" approach might be particularly interesting to you.
* They feature an expanded story focusing on the legendary Pokémon Necrozma, new characters, new Ultra Beasts, and a much larger post-game that includes battling every past villain from the series.

Given your completionist nature, the task of filling out the Alola Pokédex, completing all the trials, and exploring the extensive post-game in the *Ultra* versions could provide dozens of hours of gameplay. Plus, the colorful world and charming Pokémon make it a great game to potentially share with your kids, Levi and Evalynn.

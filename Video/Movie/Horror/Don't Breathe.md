## The Setup: Thieves vs. The Blind Man

The film introduces us to a trio of young Detroit delinquents: **Rocky** (Jane Levy), who wants to escape her abusive home life and take her younger sister with her; her boyfriend, **Money** (Daniel Zovatto); and their friend **Alex** (Dylan Minnette), whose father owns a security company, giving them inside access to alarm systems. They get a tip about a supposedly easy score: an old, **blind Gulf War veteran** (Stephen Lang) living in an isolated, abandoned neighborhood, who allegedly has a large cash settlement from a car accident that killed his daughter. They figure he's a helpless target. Boy, are they wrong.

## The Twist: Not So Helpless After All

Once inside the house, the atmosphere immediately shifts from a standard home invasion thriller to a suffocating game of cat-and-mouse. Money, being the impulsive one, shoots off a lock, waking the Blind Man. In a brutal, swift move, the Blind Man **kills Money with his own gun**, proving he's far from defenseless. He's a highly skilled, incredibly dangerous individual with heightened senses and an intimate knowledge of his home.

As Rocky and Alex try to find the money and escape, they discover the Blind Man's truly horrifying secret in the basement: a **young woman, Cindy Roberts, is chained and gagged in a makeshift padded cell**. She's the woman who killed his daughter in the car accident and, as it turns out, he's been holding her captive, intending for her to bear him a "replacement" child.

## The Climax: A Horrifying Revelation

The discovery of Cindy amplifies the stakes. Rocky and Alex attempt to free her, but the Blind Man re-enters the basement, shoots, and accidentally **kills Cindy**. He's distraught, confirming her pregnancy. Now, his focus shifts entirely to Rocky.

The most disturbing and fan-favorite (for its sheer shock value) moment of the film occurs here: the Blind Man, driven by his deranged desire for a child, **attempts to artificially inseminate Rocky using a turkey baster filled with his own semen**. This scene is a truly grotesque and unforgettable moment that solidifies the Blind Man as an absolute monster and completely flips audience sympathy, even for the criminal protagonists.

Alex, who was believed dead earlier, re-emerges to save Rocky, and they handcuff the Blind Man. But he escapes, shoots Alex, and then the final chase begins. Rocky manages to disorient the Blind Man by setting off the house alarm, hits him with a crowbar, and shoves him into the basement, where he falls onto a broken piece of wood, getting impaled.

## The Ending: A Shaky Escape

Believing the Blind Man to be dead, Rocky escapes the house just as the police arrive. In the aftermath, a news report reveals that the Blind Man is alive and recovering in the hospital. He tells the police that he killed two intruders in self-defense and claims nothing was stolen from his home. He never mentions Rocky or Cindy. This allows Rocky to get away clean with the stolen money. The final scene shows Rocky and her younger sister boarding a train, seemingly heading for California, having escaped the nightmare with the cash.

The ending leaves a lingering sense of unease. Rocky, a thief, gets away with her crimes, traumatized but ultimately successful in her objective, while the Blind Man, a truly monstrous individual, also survives, seemingly getting away with his horrific actions. It's a morally ambiguous conclusion that makes you question who, if anyone, truly "won."

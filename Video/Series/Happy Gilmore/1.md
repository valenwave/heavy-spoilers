Alright, what's up guys, and welcome back to **Spoilers**, where today we're cracking open the 1996 Adam Sandler classic, *Happy Gilmore*. If for some reason you haven't seen this movie and don't want every single punchline, the epic climax, and the fate of Shooter McGavin ruined for you, then you've definitely come to the wrong place.

So, let's get into it.

### The Setup: A Hockey Player with a Mean Slapshot

We meet Happy Gilmore, a guy whose only real skill in life is his ridiculously powerful slapshot. The problem is, he's a terrible ice skater and has a volcanic temper, so his dream of making it to the NHL is dead on arrival. He's a loveable loser living with his sweet Grandma, who raised him after his dad was killed by a stray puck at a hockey game.

The whole plot kicks off when the IRS shows up. It turns out Grandma hasn't paid taxes in about a decade, and she owes a whopping $270,000. They seize her house and ship her off to a nightmare of a nursing home. Happy is devastated and has just 90 days to come up with the cash.

While movers are clearing out the house, they find a set of old golf clubs that belonged to Happy's grandpa. They bet him he can't outdrive them. Happy, using his signature hockey-style running start, unleashes a monstrous drive that goes over 400 yards. The movers are stunned, and Happy realizes his slapshot translates perfectly to a golf swing.

### The Mentor and The Tour

Happy starts hustling at the driving range, where he's spotted by Chubbs Peterson, a former pro golfer. Chubbs is a legend with a tragic backstory: his promising career was cut short when an alligator bit his hand off during a tournament. He sees Happy's raw power and believes he can make him a champion if he can just learn to putt. Chubbs becomes his mentor, promising to teach him the short game if Happy can earn the money to join the Pro Golf Tour.

Happy, wearing hockey jerseys and screaming at his ball, is a complete disgrace to the stuffy, traditional world of golf. But he wins a local tournament and earns his tour card. The crowds love his antics, but the tour's golden boy and absolute slimeball, Shooter McGavin, hates him. Shooter sees Happy as a freak who's disrespecting the "gentleman's game."

### The Rivalry and The Meltdown

The movie is basically a series of hilarious escalations between Happy and Shooter. Happy's temper is his biggest enemy. He gets into a fistfight with his pro-am partner, Bob Barker, host of *The Price is Right*. In one of the most iconic scenes in comedy history, the two of them roll around on the grass punching each other out, ending with Barker knocking Happy out cold and delivering the legendary line, "The price is *wrong*, b\*tch!"

The Tour commissioner is about to kick Happy out, but the tour's PR head, Virginia Venit, convinces him that Happy is a ratings goldmine. She's tasked with cleaning up his image and, of course, becomes his love interest.

Things get dark when Grandma's house goes up for auction. Happy has been winning, but he doesn't have the full amount yet. At the auction, Shooter McGavin shows up and outbids Happy, buying the house purely out of spite. He then blackmails Happy: he'll give him the house back, but only if Happy agrees to quit the tour if he loses the final Tour Championship. The stakes are now intensely personal.

### The Climax: The Tour Championship

It all comes down to the final tournament. Happy is playing the golf of his life, fueled by the desire to win back his grandma's home. Shooter, realizing Happy might actually win, resorts to hiring a deranged fan named Donald to heckle and distract Happy all day.

On the final day, the heckling reaches its peak. Donald drives a Volkswagen Beetle onto the course and plows right into Happy, injuring his shoulder and shaking him to his core. Happy's game completely falls apart. He's in pain and can't drive the ball properly.

All seems lost until he gets a vision of his mentor, Chubbs (who had tragically died earlier after falling out a window in shock from seeing the alligator head Happy gifted him). Ghost Chubbs appears and gives him the final piece of advice he needs, telling him to forget his power and focus on the short game, reminding him, "It's all in the hips."

Happy rallies, and it all comes down to the 18th hole. He's tied with Shooter. In a final act of sabotage, Donald's TV tower, which he was perched on, collapses and falls directly in the path of Happy's ball and the hole. It's an impossible shot. Officials rule that he has to play it where it lies.

This is the moment everything comes together. Using his hockey instincts and the "happy place" technique Virginia taught him, Happy sees a way. He putts the ball. It hits a piece of the metal tower, ricochets off a bent lighting rig, rolls down a support beam like a Rube Goldberg machine, gets kicked by a loose piece of scrap, and trickles perfectly into the hole.

**Happy wins! The crowd goes insane!**

### The Ultimate Payoff

Happy has won the Tour Championship, the prize money, and his Grandma's house. Shooter, in a fit of rage, tries to steal Happy's ceremonial gold jacket. As he runs off with it, he's cornered by the furious crowd, led by Happy's gigantic former boss, Mr. Larson, who proceeds to beat the absolute hell out of him.

The movie ends with Happy, Grandma, Virginia, and his homeless caddy celebrating in their reclaimed home. We then cut to heaven, where Chubbs is looking down, smiling, alongside the one-eyed alligator that took his hand and Abraham Lincoln, for some reason. It's the perfect, absurd ending to a chaotic and hilarious movie.
